  "analysis": "Context:  \nâ€¢ Because the study describes a signaling mechanism without reference to any specific disease model, specialized primary cell/tissue, or pathological/environmental stress condition, the context is \"none,\" and the context type is \"Undefined/Generic.\"\n\nNodes:  \n1) Interferon alpha (protein)  \n2) Interferon gamma (protein)  \n3) ISGF3 alpha proteins (protein)  \n4) IFN-alpha-stimulated response elements (nucleic acid)  \n5) transcription (biological process)  \n\nAll node statuses = \"none\" (since context = none).\n\nRegulatory Relationships (as stated or directly implied in the abstract):  \n1) Interferon alpha phosphorylates ISGF3 alpha proteins, leading to their activation of transcription.  \n2) Interferon gamma also phosphorylates ISGF3 alpha proteins.  \n3) ISGF3 alpha proteins bind IFN-alpha-stimulated response elements and thereby activate transcription."
