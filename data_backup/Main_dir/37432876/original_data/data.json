  "title": "SNORD90 induces glutamatergic signaling following treatment with monoaminergic antidepressants",
  "abstract": "Pharmacotherapies for the treatment of major depressive disorder were serendipitously discovered almost seven decades ago. From this discovery, scientists pinpointed the monoaminergic system as the primary target associated with symptom alleviation. As a result, most antidepressants have been engineered to act on the monoaminergic system more selectively, primarily on serotonin, in an effort to increase treatment response and reduce unfavorable side effects. However, slow and inconsistent clinical responses continue to be observed with these available treatments. Recent findings point to the glutamatergic system as a target for rapid acting antidepressants. Investigating different cohorts of depressed individuals treated with serotonergic and other monoaminergic antidepressants, we found that the expression of a small nucleolar RNA, SNORD90, was elevated following treatment response. When we increased Snord90 levels in the mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region regulating mood responses, we observed antidepressive-like behaviors. We identified neuregulin 3 (NRG3) as one of the targets of SNORD90, which we show is regulated through the accumulation of N6-methyladenosine modifications leading to YTHDF2-mediated RNA decay. We further demonstrate that a decrease in NRG3 expression resulted in increased glutamatergic release in the mouse ACC. These findings support a molecular link between monoaminergic antidepressant treatment and glutamatergic neurotransmission.",
