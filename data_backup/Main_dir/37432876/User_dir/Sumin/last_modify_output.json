  "analysis": "Context: \nThe study explicitly investigates molecular events in depressed individuals treated with antidepressants. This is clearly linked to a disease state (major depressive disorder). Therefore, context = \"major depressive disorder\", context type = \"disease\".\n\nNodes (with types and context-specific status, if any): \n1. monoaminergic antidepressants → Chemical Compound, status = none  \n2. SNORD90 (small nucleolar RNA) → Gene/RNA, status = up (the abstract states SNORD90 is elevated following antidepressant treatment in depressed individuals)  \n3. N6-methyladenosine → Epitranscriptomic modification, status = none  \n4. YTHDF2 → Gene/RNA, status = none  \n5. NRG3 (neuregulin 3) → Gene/RNA, status = none  \n6. glutamatergic release → Biological Process/Pathway, status = none  \n7. antidepressive-like behaviors → Clinical Phenotype, status = none  \n\nRegulatory Relationships (direct only, with required meta-relations for m6A mechanisms):  \n1. monoaminergic antidepressants upregulate SNORD90  \n2. SNORD90 adds m6A with a downstream decrease of NRG3  \n3. m6A is on NRG3  \n4. YTHDF2 binds m6A with a downstream decay of NRG3  \n5. NRG3 downregulates glutamatergic release  \n6.
