  "title": "WTAP activates MAPK signaling through m6A methylation in VEGFA mRNA-mediated by YTHDC1 to promote colorectal cancer development",
  "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine modification, especially Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), is reportedly associated with a variety of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Angiogenesis also plays an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC. However, only a few studies have reported the biological mechanisms underlying this connection. Therefore, tissue microarray and public database were used to explore WTAP levels in CRC. Then, WTAP was down-regulated and over-expressed, respectively. CCK8, EdU, colony formation, and transwell experiments were performed to study the role of WTAP in CRC. Combined RNA sequencing and m6A RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) sequencing, we found downstream molecules VEGFA. Moreover, a tube formation assay was executed for tumor angiogenesis. Finally, a subcutaneous tumorigenesis assay in nude mice was used to examine the tumor-promoting effect of WTAP in vivo. In the present study, WTAP was significantly upregulated in CRC cells and patients with CRC. Moreover, higher WTAP expression was observed in the TCGA and CPATC databases in CRC tissues. WTAP over-expression exacerbates cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Conversely, WTAP knockdown inhibited the malignant biological behavior of CRC cells. Mechanistically, WTAP positively regulated VEGFA, as identified using RNA sequencing and MeRIP sequencing. Moreover, we identified YTHDC1 as a downstream effector of the YTHDC1-VEGFA axis in CRC. Furthermore, increased WTAP expression activated the MAPK signaling pathway, which led to enhanced angiogenesis. In conclusion, our study revealed that the WTAP/YTHDC1/VEGFA axis promotes CRC development, especially angiogenesis, suggesting that it may act as a potential biomarker of CRC.",
