  "abstract": "Fine particulate matters (PM2.5) increased the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of lung epithelium in pulmonary fibrosis remained elusive. Here we developed PM2.5-exposure lung epithelial cells and mice models to investigate the role of autophagy in lung epithelia mediating inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. PM2.5 exposure induced autophagy in lung epithelial cells and then drove pulmonary fibrosis by activation of NF-ÎºB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. PM2.5-downregulated ALKBH5 protein expression promotes m6A modification of Atg13 mRNA at site 767 in lung epithelial cells. Atg13-mediated ULK complex positively regulated autophagy and inflammation in epithelial cells with PM2.5 treatment. Knockout of ALKBH5 in mice further accelerated ULK complex-regulated autophagy, inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, our results highlighted that site-specific m6A methylation on Atg13 mRNA regulated epithelial inflammation-driven pulmonary fibrosis in an autophagy-dependent manner upon PM2.5 exposure, and it provided target intervention strategies towards PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",
