  "analysis": "Context:  \nThe abstract explicitly investigates α-synuclein regulation via METTL14-mediated m6A modification in Parkinson’s disease (PD); thus, the context is “Parkinson’s disease,” context type = “disease.”\n\nNodes (with context-specific status):  \n• METTL14 → gene, down (explicitly decreased in PD)  \n• METTL3 → gene, down (explicitly decreased in PD)  \n• YTHDF2 → gene, down (explicitly decreased in PD)  \n• N6-methyladenosine (m6A) → epitranscriptomic modification, down (overall m6A levels decreased in PD)  \n• α-synuclein → protein, none (no explicit statement that α-syn is up/down in PD, so status = none)  \n\nRegulatory Relationships (direct statements in the abstract):  \n1) METTL14 methylates m6A, leading to decreased α-synuclein (weakened mRNA stability).  \n2) m6A is on α-synuclein.  \n3) YTHDF2 binds m6A, causing decreased α-synuclein (decay of α-syn transcripts)."
