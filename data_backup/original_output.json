  "analysis": "Context:  \nBecause the molecular mechanism is explicitly linked to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the context is “clear cell renal cell carcinoma,” and the context type is “disease.”\n\nNodes:  \n1) fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO): gene, downregulated in ccRCC  \n2) N6-methyladenosine (m6A): RNA modification, NULL  \n3) PGC-1alpha: protein, NULL  \n4) tumour growth: clinical phenotype, NULL  \n5) patient survival: clinical phenotype, NULL  \n\nRegulatory Relationships (Summarized):  \n• FTO reduces m6A, which leads to increased PGC-1alpha expression (meta-relation).  \n• m6A is on PGC-1alpha.  \n• PGC-1alpha reduces tumour growth.  \n• tumour growth reduces patient survival.  \n• FTO increases patient survival (inferred from low FTO correlating with poor survival)."
