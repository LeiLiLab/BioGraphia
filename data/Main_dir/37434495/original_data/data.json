  "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. The mechanism of psoriasis pathogenesis is not entirely clear. Here, we reported that the level of the N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) modification was increased in psoriatic CD4+ T cells compared with healthy controls. In the psoriasis mouse model, depletion of the RNA demethylase, Alkbh5, from CD4+ T cells promoted the psoriasis-like phenotype and inflammation. Intriguingly, this phenotype and inflammation were alleviated by the ablation of the m6 A methyltransferase Mettl3 in CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, we found that the m6 A modification of IL17A mRNA increased the expression of IL-17A (an important pro-inflammatory factor in psoriasis) and promoted psoriasis. Thus, our study provided evidence that the m6 A modification of IL17A in CD4+ T cells regulates inflammation in psoriasis.",
