    "PROMPT_TEMPLATE": "\nYour task is to construct a pathway graph representing the molecular regulatory mechanism described in a given scientific journal abstract. Follow these specific instructions in each step carefully.\n\nStep1. Context Identification\nStrict rules apply to context identification. Determine the context only if the molecular mechanism is explicitly linked to a defined biological condition. The context of the pathway must fall into one of the following context type: disease, cell/tissue, pathological/environmental stress, and Undefined/Generic.\n\n- Disease: The study explicitly states that the molecular mechanism is investigated in the context of a disease model (e.g., cancer, obesity, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease).\n- Cell/Tissue: The study is conducted in primary cells, tissues, organoids, or an in vivo model. Standard immortalized cell lines alone do not qualify.\n- Pathological/Environmental Stress: The study examines the pathway under a disease-related stress condition (e.g., hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammation, drug treatment). Generic stress in standard cell cultures does not qualify.\n- Undefined/Generic: When a study investigates molecular pathways in a baseline or standard experimental setting without a specific disease model, specialized tissue context, or pathological/environmental stress condition. This non-specific context (none) applies, for example, to standard immortalized cell line experiments or normal physiological processes where there is no explicit disease or stress context. \n\nStrict Context Assignment Rules\n1. For standard cell line studies: If the study only uses immortalized cell lines without explicitly linking findings to a disease or stress condition, assign context = none, context type = Undefined/Generic.\n2. Do not assume disease relevance: If the study does not explicitly mention a disease model, do not infer a disease association.\n3. Do not assume a biological process is a disease: If the study investigates a normal biological process (e.g., adipogenesis, differentiation) without linking it to a disease, context = none, context type = Undefined/Generic.\n4. Drug/Treatment Studies Must Be in a Disease Model: If the study examines the effects of a compound (e.g., chemotherapy, small molecules) but does not specify a disease model, context = none, context type = Undefined/Generic.\n\nFinal Validation Step for Context:\nIf context ≠ none, the study must clearly fit one of the three categories.\nIf context = none, no assumptions should be made about disease relevance.\n\nContext Assignment Examples:\n\"m6A demethylation promotes breast cancer cell proliferation.\" → Context: breast cancer, Context Type: disease\n\"Hypoxia enhances glycolysis in glioblastoma cells.\" → Context: glioblastoma, Context Type: disease\n\"Obesity induces FTO overexpression in adipose tissue.\" → Context: obesity, Context Type: disease\n\"m6A modification regulates differentiation in mouse primary muscle tissue.\" → Context: muscle tissue, Context Type: cell/tissue\n\nExamples for non-specific context (none):\n\"m6A regulates mRNA modifications in HEK293 cells.\" → Context: none, Context Type: Undefined/Generic (No explicit disease or stress condition)\n\"Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.\" → Context: none, Context Type: Undefined/Generic (Adipogenesis is not a disease, and no disease is mentioned)\n\"Oxidative stress alters gene expression in fibroblast cultures.\" → Context: none, Context Type: Undefined/Generic (Pathological stress but no disease model)\n\n\n\nStep2. Node Identification\nIdentify all key entities involved in the pathway. Do not use acronym for nodes. Node type classification is required. Each node should be classified as one of the following types: Gene/RNA, Nucleic Acid, Protein, Epigenetic modification, Epitranscriptomic modification, Post-Translational Modification, pathogen, Biological Process/Pathway, Chemical Compound, Disease, Clinical Phenotype, Tissue/Cell Type, Experimental Model, and Other. \n\n- Gene/RNA: Any segment of DNA encoding a functional RNA or protein product, or transcribed RNA molecules (coding or non-coding)\nExamples: Human genes (e.g., TP53, MYC), Viral genes (e.g., KSHV ORFs), mRNAs (e.g., the transcript for METTL3), Non-coding RNAs (e.g., miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, viral RNAs)\n\n- Nucleic Acid: DNA or RNA sequences as structural/regulatory entities rather than functional gene products.\nExamples: Genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, promoters, enhancers, or other cis-regulatory elements, Viral genomic DNA or RNA (e.g., KSHV’s double-stranded DNA genome)\n\n- Protein: Polypeptides produced from genes, including enzymes, receptors, transcription factors, structural proteins, and more.\nExamples: Human proteins (e.g., c-Abl, p53, METTL3, FTO), Viral proteins (e.g., KSHV LANA)\n\n- Epigenetic modification: any covalent or chemical modification that occurs on DNA\nExamples: 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) in CpG islands (common epigenetic mark on DNA), 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)\n\n- Epitranscriptomic modification: any covalent or chemical modification that occurs on RNA molecules \nExamples: N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA, 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) on tRNA/mRNA, Pseudouridine (Ψ) on various RNAs\n\n- Post-Translational Modification: Covalent modifications of proteins after translation.\nExamples: Phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, glycosylation, acetylation\n\n- pathogen: any infectious agent (e.g., virus, bacterium, fungus, parasite) that can cause disease in its host. This includes the organism as a whole, specific life-cycle stages, or pathogenic genes/proteins associated with virulence, replication, and infection processes.\nExamples: Viruses (Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, Epstein–Barr virus, HIV), Bacteria (Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus species), or Parasites (Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania donovani)\n\n- Biological Process/Pathway: Cellular or molecular processes, usually multi-step, that involve multiple molecular components. Or larger, named regulatory or metabolic networks\nExamples: Cell cycle (e.g., S phase, G1/S transition), Transcription, translation, splicing, Wnt signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, MAPK cascade\n\n- Chemical Compound: Any small molecule or synthetic/natural chemical entity that plays a biochemical, pharmacological, or regulatory role in biological systems.\nExamples: Metabolites (e.g., ATP, glucose, amino acids), Drugs or Medicines (e.g., chemotherapy agents, small-molecule inhibitors, over-the-counter drugs), Experimental Compounds (e.g., novel chemical probes, research chemicals), Ligands (e.g., hormones, cofactors)\n\n- Disease: Specific diseases or pathological conditions.\nExamples: Cancer types (e.g., cervical squamous cell carcinoma), KSHV-associated pathologies (Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma), Metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes)\n\n- Clinical Phenotype: Observable clinical traits or responses in patients or experimental models.\nExamples: Survival outcome, Drug resistance, Tumor metastasis\n\n- Tissue/Cell Type: Biological source context—organs, tissues, primary cells, or specialized cell types (if you track them in the graph).\nExamples: Endothelial cells, B cells, fibroblasts, lung tissue\n\n- Experimental Model\nDefinition: Cell lines, organoids, or animal models used in studies, if you want to capture them explicitly.\nExamples: HeLa cells, 293T cells, mouse xenograft models\n\n- Other\nDefinition: A fallback category for any node that does not fit any of the previously defined types (e.g., Gene/RNA, Protein, Pathogen, etc.). Use this classification sparingly for entities that cannot clearly be categorized under the existing node types or when their nature is ambiguous in the context of the data. \nExamples: any unrecognized or miscellaneous entity that does not align with the above node definitions (e.g., Gene/RNA, Protein, Pathogen, etc.)\n\n\n\nStep3. Context-Specific Node Status (Strict Rule Enforcement)\nCritical Rule: Context-Specific Status Can Exist Only if Context ≠ none\nIf context = none, then all nodes must have status = none.\nIf context ≠ none, a context-specific status can be assigned only if the study explicitly confirms an observed status (e.g., \"Gene X is upregulated in cancer cells\").\nDo not assign a context-specific status if the study does not specify an observed expression levels or expression changes under the given condition.\n\nFinal Validation Step for Node Status:\nIf context = \"none\", all nodes must have status = \"none\"(no exceptions).\nIf any node has a status other than \"none\", the study must have an assigned context.\n\n\n\nStep4. Direct Regulatory Relations\nClearly define how nodes interact in the pathway using regulatory relationships.\n\nRules for Edges:\n- Use explicit terms (e.g., upregulate, bind, decay, inhibit).\n- Do not assume indirect interactions — include only directly stated relationships in the abstract.\n- Logical ordering of interactions: Ensure that regulatory relationships reflect a biological hierarchy: If a node is in a neutral or positive state, its effect on downstream targets should be logically consistent. If inhibition or reduction is involved, relation should be able to logically track the cascaded effects properly.\n\nExample of Logical Ordering:\n- If YTHDF2 knockdown upregulates KRAS, this means normal YTHDF2 expression downregulates KRAS. The correct relation should be written as \"YTHDF2 downregulates KRAS.\" This approach ensures that all relationships reflect biological causality, preventing incorrect assumptions about indirect effects.\n\n\n\nstep5. Meta-Relations for direct relations having secondary effects.\nA meta-relation represents the indirect or secondary effects of a molecular event. It captures mechanistic dependencies between biological interactions, particularly when a molecular modification (e.g., RNA modification, phosphorylation) leads to downstream functional changes. The meta-relation can be used when a primary relation between two nodes has indirect or secondary effects to other nodes. \n\nMeta-relations follow this structured format:\n{\n  \"head\": \"NODE_1\",\n  \"tail\": \"NODE_2\",\n  \"label\": \"relation_value\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"relation_value\", \"target\": \"NODE_3\"}]\n}\n\nIf Post-Translational Modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, glycosylation, acetylation have seconday effects in their mechanisms, then they should be represented as meta-relation. \n\nExample: The DNA binding activity is regulated by cdc2-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting a cell cycle function for c-Abl.\n\"relations\" : [\n\t{\n  \"head\": \"cdc2\",\n  \"tail\": \"phosphorylation\",\n  \"label\": \"mediate\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"regulate\", \"target\": \"c-Abl\"}]\n},\n\t{\n  \"head\": \"c-Abl\",\n  \"tail\": \"DNA\",\n  \"label\": \"bind\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"NULL\", \"target\": \"NULL\"}]\n}\n]\n\nExample: DDK phosphorylates Mcm4, affecting S-phase progression\n\"relations\" : [\n\t\t{\n  \"head\": \"DDK\",\n  \"tail\": \"Mcm4\",\n  \"label\": \"phosphorylate\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"affect\", \"target\": \"S-phase progression\"}]\n}\n]\n\nEpitranscriptomic (RNA-level) modification such as N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNA, 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) on tRNA/mRNA, Pseudouridine (Ψ) on various RNAs can have secondary effects in their mechanisms. For example, A m6A regulators (writers, erasers, and readers) interact with m6A modifications on mRNAs. To maintain consistency and accuracy, all RNA modifications (including m6A, m5C, Ψ, etc.) must follow strict meta-relation rules as demonstrated in the m6A examples. These rules ensure that RNA modifications are explicitly linked to their regulators (writers, erasers, readers) and target genes while preserving secondary effects.\n\nStrict Rules for RNA Modifications in Meta-Relations\n- Mandatory Representation of RNA Modifications as Meta-Relations: RNA modifications (e.g., m6A, m5C, Ψ) must be explicitly represented in all triplets. Direct \"A modifies B\" statements are NOT allowed without referencing RNA modification.\n- Strict Relation Structure for RNA Modifications: The RNA modification (e.g., m6A, m5C, Ψ) must always be the target of the modification enzyme (writers, erasers, or readers). The modification's effect on gene expression must be embedded in a meta-relation.\n- Allowed Relations for RNA Modifiers (e.g., Writers, Erasers, Readers):\nWriters (e.g., METTL3, METTL14, NSUN2, PUS1) → \"methylate\", \"add\"\nErasers (e.g., FTO, ALKBH5, TET2) → \"remove\", \"reduce\", \"demethylate\"\nReaders (e.g., YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDC1, ALYREF, IGF2BP1) → \"bind\"\n- RNA Modification Must Be Explicitly Linked to Target Gene: The modification must point to the target gene. If there's any secondary effect (e.g., decay, stability, translation increase), it must be in the metaRelation field.\n\nExample: Let's say an m6A reader protein (e.g., YTHDF2) binds to m6A and causes transcript decay. \"YTHDF2 degrades GENE_NAME\" is incorrect relation, which misses m6A mechanism. This should be represent with meta-relation as follow:\n\"relations\" : [\n\t{\n\t\t{\n  \"head\": \"m6A\",\n  \"tail\": \"GENE_NAME\",\n  \"label\": \"is on\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"NULL\", \"target\": \"NULL\"}]\n},\n\t\t{\n  \"head\": \"YTHDF2\",\n  \"tail\": \"m6A\",\n  \"label\": \"bind\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"decay\", \"target\": \"GENE_NAME\"}]\n}\n]\n\nExample: Let's say an m6A eraser protein (e.g., FTO) reduces m6A, leading to increased gene expression. \"FTO increases GENE_NAME\" is incorrect relation, which misses m6A mechanism. This should be represent with a meta-relation as follow:\n\"relations\" : [\n\t{\n  \"head\": \"FTO\",\n  \"tail\": \"m6A\",\n  \"label\": \"reduce\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"increase\", \"target\": \"GENE_NAME\"}]\n},\n{\n  \"head\": \"m6A\",\n  \"tail\": \"GENE_NAME\",\n  \"label\": \"is on\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"NULL\", \"target\": \"NULL\"}]\n}\n]\n\nExample: Let's say an m5C reader protein (e.g., ALYREF) promotes nuclear exports of m5C modified VEGFA transcripts.\n\"relations\" : [\n\t{\n  \"head\": \"ALYREF\",\n  \"tail\": \"m5C\",\n  \"label\": \"bind\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"promote\", \"target\": \"VEGFA nuclear export\"}]\n},\n\t{\n  \"head\": \"m5C\",\n  \"tail\": \"VEGFA\",\n  \"label\": \"is on\",\n  \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"NULL\", \"target\": \"NULL\"}]\n}\n]\n\nWarning: Do not collapse multi-step processes into a single triple with a metaRelation if they involve an intermediary node. Each direct interaction must be represented as its own relation. If X affects Y, and Y in turn affects Z, you should represent both interactions separately rather than collapsing them into a single triple with a metaRelation. A metaRelation must not include a different molecule or a different node in the “secondary” target if the description in the abstract states that an intermediary molecule is responsible. The presence of any such intermediary molecule means you must create two separate direct relations.\n\n\nstep6. Final Validation Checklist\nBefore finalizing a metaRelation, confirm whether it represents a truly direct downstream effect of the same source node–target node interaction. If the effect in question is mediated by a separate node, break it out into its own relation. Systematically review the following explicit rules/questions and perform a final logic check to verify that no metaRelation includes an effect on a node that isn’t the same as the primary relation’s target (or the same direct process). If such a mismatch occurs, separate the actions into distinct relations. \n- Any mention of a node A that modulates node B, which in turn modulates node C, must create two separate relations. “A → B” is one relation, and “B → C” is another. Do not flatten it into “A → B (metaRelation → C).”\n- Never combine “A decreases B and therefore increases C” into a single triple. Instead, produce: “A decreases B.” and “B decreases C.” (Hence, less B → higher C is understood at the network level.)\n- Does each primary relation describe a single, direct action between the source and target?\n- If there is an intermediary node, the relation must be split into multiple relations.\n- Are you including any metaRelation that references a separate node outside of the immediate direct interaction?\n- If yes, you must convert it to separate direct relations.\nDoes the metaRelation truly represent a direct secondary effect on the same target?\n- If the “secondary” effect is mediated by a different node, it must be a separate direct relation.\n- In each triple, confirm whether the source physically or functionally ‘touches’ the target in the same step.\n- If not, break it up.\n\n\nstep7. Output Format (JSON)\nThe pathway graph should be structured in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"context\": [\n  {\n\t  \"name\": \"namevalue\",\n\t  \"type\": \"typevalue\"}\n    ], \n  \"entities\": {\n    \"node_value\": [\"node_type\", \"context_specific_node_status\"]\n  },\n  \"relations\": [\n       {\n        \"head\": \"node_value\",\n        \"tail\": \"node_value\",\n        \"label\": \"relation_value\", \n        \"metaRelations\": [{\"relation\": \"relation_value\", \"target\": \"node_value\"}]\n      }\n  ]\n}\n\nBelow is an example, showcasing how the pathway should be extracted. \n\nAbstract: \nBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA plays a role in regulating adipogenesis. However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, plays a critical role in anti-obesity and anti-adipogenesis. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) was performed to determine the m6A levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The effects of EGCG on the m6A levels in specific genes were determined by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative real-time PCR (meRIP-qPCR). Several adipogenesis makers and cell cycle genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining. All measurements were performed at least for three times.RESULTS: Here we showed that EGCG inhibited adipogenesis by blocking the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. Exposing 3T3-L1 cells to EGCG reduced the expression of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein, an m6A demethylase, which led to increased overall levels of RNA m6A methylation. Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) play vital roles in MCE. The m6A levels of CCNA2 and CDK2 mRNA were dramatically enhanced by EGCG. Interestingly, EGCG increased the expression of YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2), which recognized and decayed methylated mRNAs, resulting in decreased protein levels of CCNA2 and CDK2. As a result, MCE was blocked and adipogenesis was inhibited. FTO overexpression and YTHDF2 knockdown in 3T3-L1 cells significantly increased CCNA2 and CDK2 protein levels and ameliorated the EGCG-induced adipogenesis inhibition. Thus, m6A-dependent CCNA2 and CDK2 expressions mediated by FTO and YTHDF2 contributed to EGCG-induced adipogenesis inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how m6A is involved in the EGCG regulation of adipogenesis and shed light on its anti-obesity effect.\n\nContext: The study is conducted in 3T3-L1 cells, which are an immortalized cell line. While the study examines adipogenesis, it does not explicitly link the mechanism to obesity or another pathological condition. The effect of EGCG (a natural compound) on adipogenesis is studied, but it is not associated with a specific disease or stress-related perturbation. Thus, according to the provided strict definition, the context for this molecular regulatory pathway is \"none\".\n\nNodes:\n1. Epigallocatechin gallate: this is a chemical compound.\n2.

This enzyme exists in either of two forms: the major one contains cdk7, cyclin H and an assembly factor called MAT-1, whilst the minor one lacks MAT-1. Cdk7 is unusual among cdks because it contains not one but two residues (S170 and T176 in Xenopus cdk7) in its T-loop that are phosphorylated in vivo. We have investigated the role of S170 and T176 phosphorylation in the assembly and activity of cyclin H-cdk7 dimers. In the absence of MAT-1, phosphorylation of the T-loop appears to be required for cdk7 to bind cyclin H. Phosphorylation of both residues does not require cyclin H binding in vitro. Phosphorylation of S170 is sufficient for cdk7 to bind cyclin H with low affinity, but high affinity binding requires T176 phosphorylation. By mutational analysis, we demonstrate that in addition to its role in promotion of cyclin H binding, S170 phosphorylation plays a direct role in the control of CAK activity. Finally, we show that dual phosphorylation of S170 and T176, or substitution of both phosphorylatable residues by aspartic residues, is sufficient to generate CAK activity to one-third of its maximal value in vitro, even in the absence of cyclin H and MAT-1, and may thus provide further clues as to how cyclins activate cdk subunits.\"\n\nContext: \nThis study focuses on a general molecular mechanism without a defined biological condition.
