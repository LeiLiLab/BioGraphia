  "analysis": "Context:  \nBased on the abstract, the study specifically investigates how arsenite-induced oxidative stress modulates YTHDF2 phase separation. Because arsenite exposure (an environmental toxin) leads to oxidative stress in human keratinocytes, this constitutes a “pathological/environmental stress” context.\n\nNodes:  \n1. Arsenite → chemical compound  \n2. N-acetylcysteine → chemical compound  \n3. Oxidative stress → biological process/pathway  \n4. N6-methyladenosine → epitranscriptomic modification  \n5. m6A methylesterase → protein  \n6. m6A demethylase → protein  \n7. YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 → gene (following the naming convention in the sample)  \n8. YTHDF2 phase separation → biological process/pathway  \n\nRegulatory Relationships (direct statements from the abstract):  \n1. Arsenite upregulates oxidative stress.  \n2. Oxidative stress promotes YTHDF2 phase separation.  \n3. N-acetylcysteine downregulates oxidative stress.  \n4. N-acetylcysteine inhibits YTHDF2 phase separation.  \n5. Arsenite upregulates N6-methyladenosine.  \n6. N-acetylcysteine downregulates N6-methyladenosine.  \n7. m6A methylesterase methylates N6-methyladenosine.  \n8. m6A demethylase removes N6-methyladenosine.  \n9. YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 binds N6-methyladenosine (meta-relation: promotes YTHDF2 phase separation)."
